# snakeGame

This project is made using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. The program is a replication of the classic Snake Game that everyone played at some point of their lives. The goal is to simply eat the food shown by the white colors on the grid, using the lightblue head to create an elongated "snake body".

There are 2 primary indicatiors for the user to see, these two indicators are Score and High score. One is used to tell the user how much food they've eaten, and the High score indicator saves the data from the Score in local storage and provides it to the user on top of the screen.
